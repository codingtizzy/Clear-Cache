This simple script will clear the cache/content of you browser.
I have manually written the most used browsers, meaning that it is possible for it to not work, if you do not have a common browser.
You should be able to easily tell which browsers this works with based off the code and looking at which directories it looks for.
With that, it must be in the default directory. If you have it inside of a custom directory, it will not be able to find it.
Thanks for trying this out!
